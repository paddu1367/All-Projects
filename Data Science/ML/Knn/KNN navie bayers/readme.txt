Accuracy after age data is removed:

As we see in the above results the accuracy of Knn and navie bayes models have increased after removing of the age data. Between models navie bayes has more accuracy than Knn. Since we have to define �k� in Knn and the entire data is used to evaluate the test in the navie bayes It has more significant results.  So, Navie bayes is better than Knn.
